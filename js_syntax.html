<!--
    JavaScript syntax is the set of rules, how JavaScript programs are constructed

    JavaScript Values
    The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

        Fixed values
        Variable values

    Fixed values are called Literals.
    Variable values are called Variables.
-->
<!--
    In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.
    JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.
    An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.
-->


<h2>JavaScript Variables</h2>

<p>In this example, x is defined as a variable.
Then, x is assigned the value of 6:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
let x;
x = 6;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
</script>
