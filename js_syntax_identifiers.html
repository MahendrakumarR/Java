    Identifiers are JavaScript names.
    Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions.

    The rules for legal names are the same in most programming languages.

    A JavaScript name must begin with:

        A letter (A-Z or a-z)
        A dollar sign ($)
        Or an underscore (_)

<h2>JavaScript is Case Sensitive</h2>

<p>Try to change lastName to lastname.</p>

<script>
// javascript are case sensitive
let lastname, lastName;
lastName = "Doe";
lastname = "Peterson";
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = lastName;

<!--
    JavaScript and Camel Case

    Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.

    Underscore:

    first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city.

    Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case):

    FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity.

    Lower Camel Case:

    JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter:

    firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.
