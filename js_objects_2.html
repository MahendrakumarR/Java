<!--
    A method is a function stored as a property
-->

<!--
    In an object method, 'this' refers to the object.
    Alone, 'this' refers to the global object.
    In a function, 'this' refers to the global object.
    In a function, in strict mode, 'this' is undefined.
    In an event, 'this' refers to the element that received the event.
    Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer 'this' to any object.

<!--
    'this' is not a variable. It is a keyword. You cannot change the value of this.

  id: 5566,
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};
