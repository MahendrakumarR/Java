<!--    
    HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.
    When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.
-->
<!--
    Here are some examples of HTML events:

    An HTML web page has finished loading
    An HTML input field was changed
    An HTML button was clicked

    Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.
    JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.
    HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.
