    In real life, a car is an object.
    A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop
    All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car.
    All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.

<h2>JavaScript Objects</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
// Create an object:
const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};

// Display some data from the object:
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "The car type is : " + car.type;
</script>

<!--========================== Use another method of object ==================================-->


<p>You can use person.property or person["property"].</p>

<p id="object"></p>

<script>
// Create an object:
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName : "Doe",
  id     :  5566
};

// Display some data from the object:
document.getElementById("object").innerHTML =
person["firstName"] + " " + person["lastName"];
</script>
